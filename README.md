# credit-risk-classification

Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. 


Results
Original Data
1.	Correctly predicted all loans that were healthy as healthy.
2.	Correctly predicted 89% of high-risk loans. 
3.	The accuracy score is 94.4%.
Resampled Training Data
1.	100% accurate recall. 
2.	100% precision with healthy loans that are healthy.
3.	87% precision, the model predicted some at-risk loans as healthy. 
4.	Accuracy score: 99.6%

Summary

The machine learning model is incredibly accurate at analyzing high-risk and healthy loans, with a 100% accurate recall and precision with healthy loans. The only time when the model doesn't perform at 100% is when the model predicts some high-risk loans as healthy. 
Overall, I highly recommend the company to use this model because of the high accuracy score of 99.6%. The model is very good at predicting which loans are healthy and almost as good at predicting high-risk loans.
